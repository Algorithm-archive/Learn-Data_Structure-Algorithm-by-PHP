# Linear Search

**Linear search** is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

#### JavaScript Implementation

Though it is very easy in JavaScript to find index of an item in a list using [indexOf method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf?v=example):

`list.indexOf(item)`

but sometimes you might need to do some customization on the searching algorithm. Like- *'finding the last occurrence of the item in the list'* etc. This linear search implementation will help you to do that.
