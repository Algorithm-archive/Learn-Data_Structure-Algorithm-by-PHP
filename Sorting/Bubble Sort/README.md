# Bubble Sort

**Bubble Sort** is an algorithm which is used to sort **N** elements that are given in a memory for eg: an Array with N number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the element one by one and sort them based on their values.

It is called Bubble sort, because *with each iteration the smaller element in the list bubbles up towards the first place*, just like a water bubble rises up to the water surface.

Sorting takes place by stepping through all the data items one-by-one in pairs and comparing adjacent data items and swapping each pair that is out of order.

**A visualization on the algorithm:**

Starting from the beginning of the list, compare every adjacent pair, swap their position if they are not in the right order (the latter one is smaller than the former one). After each iteration, one less element (the last one) is needed to be compared until there are no more elements left to be compared.
